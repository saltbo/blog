  title = "chekun's blog"
  link = "https://chekun.me"
  avatar = "/media/links/chekun.jpg"
  description = "A full-stack developer"

[wangbo]
  title = "Boof Wang"
  link = "http://boof.wang"
  avatar = "/media/links/wangbo.jpg"

```

Write your portfolio as a post here, if you want comments in about page, you should turn comments to `true`.

### The resume page

The resume page will be located at `/resume` off your website root. Different
from the about page, the resume page is intended as a one pager that you
can print out for job hunting.

## Build

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Big Change**
>
> This theme has been using hugo pipes instead of webpack now, no build package needed now.

I use [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/) to make images load faster, I recommend this tool to you.

_From Hugo 0.28, the default syntax hightlighter in Hugo is [Chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma); it is built in Go and is really, really fast ‚Äì and for the most important parts compatible with [Pygments](http://pygments.org/)._

```bash
$ hugo gen chromastyles --style=monokai > ./src/styles/partials/syntax.css
```

Run hugo gen `chromastyles -h` for more options. See <https://help.farbox.com/pygments.html> for a gallery of available styles.

## Nearly finished

In order to see your site in action, run Hugo's built-in local server.

```bash
$ hugo server
```

Now enter [localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313) in the address bar of your browser.
